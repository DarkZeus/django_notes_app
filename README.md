## Notes
A very little app that I created using Python 3.9 and Django 3.1 to demonstrate my knowledge of framework and programming language itself. 

## Demo
You can try demo at [Heroku](https://fuad-notes-app.herokuapp.com) (remember to wait a bit so that Heroku need to wake up the server after a sleep). It is hosted on top of Heroku free-tier and gunicorn WSGI HTTP Web Server.

## Features
- Auth system with built-in implementation;
- Creating notes which consist of title and description. Each note attached to it's author;
- Creating tasks. Each task attached to it's author;
- Admin section with managing notes and profiles directly.

## Todo
- [x] ~~Add the ability to create todo lists~~ (Was added 05.04.2021)
